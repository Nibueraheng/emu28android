  <h1><a name=s1>1. General</a></h1>
    <p><a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/emu28.htm">Emu28</a> is based on
    the sources of <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/emu48.htm">Emu48</a>
    and is an emulator for the Hewlett Packard Clamshell calculators HP18C
    and HP28C hardware. These calculators are based on the 1LK7 Saturn
    CPU, the 1LP2 Centipede and 1LP4 ROM chips. The HP18C isn't tested,
    because I have no ROM image of it.</p>
  <h1><a name=s2>2. Acknowledgements</a></h1>
    <p>A big thank to Cyrille de Brebisson for his technical assistance and
    to Jean-Francois Garnier for his work on the HP28C. Lode Vandevenne
    spent the PNG image decoder. Also thanks to Sebastien Carlier for his
    Emu48 v1.0, without him this emulator would never have been created.
    And finally I want to thank all the unnamed authors for publishing
    material about this calculators.</p>
  <h1><a name=s3>3. ROM Images</a></h1>
    <p>You need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_image">ROM
    images</a>. The necessary ROM images are copyrighted by Hewlett Packard
    and I have no license to distribute them. Please don't ask me, I will
    not send you mine.</p>
    <p>ROM images are valid in a packed (even address lower nibble, odd address
    higher nibble) or unpacked (one nibble per byte with even address first)
    form. They can be validated with the <i>CHAMPCHK.EXE</i> command line
    utility. <i>CHAMPCHK.EXE</i> is part of the Emu28 installation package
    or of binary distribution.
    To do that, start a Command Prompt while running Windows, and type:</p>
    <blockquote>Lewiscrc &lt;image-file&gt;</blockquote>
    <p>where &lt;image-file&gt; is the ROM image you want to test. As result
    you will get a report of the Checksum check.</p>
  <h1><a name=s4>4. Installation</a></h1>
    <p>To install Emu28, unzip the emulator and the required emulator skins
    into an empty directory or use the Emu28 installer package. Finally copy
    your ROM images into this directory and adjust the ROM image name to the
    name used in the corresponding KML script. When you first run Emu28, it
    will detect the directory in which you installed it, and will write the
    configuration to the registry at <i>HKCU\Software\Emu28</i>.</p>
  <h1><a name=s5>5. How to Start</a></h1>
    <p>When Emu28 is installed and you have put the valid ROM image(s) into your
    Emu28 installation directory, you can start Emu28. You'll see a
    &quot;Choose Your KML Script&quot; box.</p>
    <p>KML (Keyboard Mapping Language) scripts define the visual aspects of
    Emu28, the behaviour of the buttons, of the keyboard, ... It's a
    <b>great</b> way to customize your copy of Emu28.</p>
    <p>Check in this dialog that the path in the &quot;Emu28 Directory&quot;
    text area points to the directory in which you installed the Emu28 KML
    files. Click the refresh button (&quot;V&quot;) after modifying the
    directory path manually to update the list box or use the
    (&quot;...&quot;) button to start a directory browser.</p>
    <p>Choose a KML script in the list box for your calculator ROM you put into
    Emu28's directory.</p>
    <p>Available scripts from the author at the moment are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Christoph's Real HP28C</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are interested in writing new scripts, get the KML 2.0
    documentation from <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/emu48.htm">the
    authors Emu48 page</a>.</p>
    <p>Having selected a script, press OK to start the emulator. In most
    cases, when Emu28 crash after pressing the OK button, you are using
    an invalid ROM image. While it's running, you can use the
    &quot;<a href="#ss10.1">View/Change KML Script...</a>&quot; command to
    change the visual aspect of Emu28.</p>
  <h1><a name=s6>6. Command Line</a></h1>
    <p>The command line syntax is &quot;<i>Emu28 [file]</i>&quot;. The
    parameter sets the filename of the emulation state file independent
    from the &quot;LastDocument&quot; setting, normally reponsible for
    opening the last used state file. The argument is optional.</p>
  <h1><a name=s7>7. Virtual Keyboard</a></h1>
    <p>There are two ways to use the virtual keyboard on the emulated
    calculator:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#mouse">by Mouse</a></li>
      <li><a href="#keyboard">by PC keyboard</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p><a name=mouse></a>
    The easiest way to use the emulated calculator is by using the mouse. The
    KML script defines buttons with an area where mouse clicks take effect.
    The active area is indicated by changing the cursor from an arrow to a
    hand cursor. Pressing the left mouse button over an active area will
    press the virtual button. When the mouse cursor leaves the virtual key
    area with still the left mouse button pressed, the virtual button is
    automatically released. The visual aspect of a pressed or released
    virtual button is defined in the KML script. In some cases you need to
    press more than one key on the emulator. For these cases press the
    virtual key with the right mouse button. When you release the mouse
    button or leave the area of the virtual key, the key is still held.
    To release all held virtual buttons, just use the left mouse button
    again. A single release of a hold virtual key isn't possible.</p>
    <p><a name=keyboard></a>
    Another convenient way is using the PC keyboard. The KML script language
    supports a large variety of commands to implement this feature. So
    keyboard usage mostly depends on your used KML script and not on the
    emulator. Because of this it's impossible to say what's happen when you
    press a key on the PC keyboard. Some Windows specific accelerator keys
    like F10 cannot be overloaded by the KML script. For further details
    read the KML 2.0 documentation mentioned before please.</p>
  <h1><a name=s8>8. File Menu</a></h1>
  <h2><a name=ss8.1>8.1 New...</a></h2>
    <p>Creates a new emulation session. You're asked for a KML script where
    you can select the calculator type and skin to emulate.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss8.2>8.2 Open...</a></h2>
    <p>Opens a previously saved emulation session. The emulation continues
    at the same position where the session was aborted. Loading emulation
    sessions made with a different ROM revision may <u>destroy</u> the memory
    content or may cause other unpredictable results.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss8.3>8.3 Save</a></h2>
    <p>Saves the current session with the actual name.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss8.4>8.4 Save As...</a></h2>
    <p>Saves the current session with a new name. You're also get this
    dialog when you Exit a new session without a state file name.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss8.5>8.5 Close</a></h2>
    <p>Closes the current session without closing the emulator.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss8.6>8.6 Settings</a></h2>
    <p>This calls the Settings dialog. This dialog has four sections:
    General, Disassembler, Sound and Infrared Printer.</p>
  <h3>8.6.1 General section</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Authentic Calculator Speed</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, the emulation speed will be similar to
      the real calculator.</p></li>
      <li><i>Show Title</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, the window title bar is visible.</p></li>
      <li><i>Show Menu</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, the menu bar is enabled. If unchecked,
      the menu is accessible as context menu in the client area outside the
      calculator button definitions.</p></li>
      <li><i>Always On Top</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, the emulator windows will always be the
      topmost one.</p></li>
      <li><i>Activation Follows Mouse</i>
      <p>This option enables a X-Mouse style windows activation. When the
      mouse is moved over the emulator window, the emulator is getting the
      focus and popping up into foreground.</p></li>
      <li><i>Single Instance</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, only one instance of the emulator can
      be started. If another running instance is detected, the detected
      instance is set into foreground as active window and get a request to
      change his state file to the given one by the current instance. Then
      the current instance is terminated.</p></li>
      <li><i>Automatically Save Files</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, the current state file will automatically
      saved when you change to another state file, but not when you close the
      emulator program.</p></li>
      <li><i>Automatically Save Files On Exit</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, the current state file will be saved
      automatically when the emulator program is closed.</p></li>
      <li><i>Show Load Object Warning</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, you'll get a warning message box when you
      try to load an object to stack level 1 over the <i>Load Object...</i>
      menu. If this option is unchecked, the warning will be skipped.</p></li>
      <li><i>Always Show KML Compilation Result</i>
      <p>When this option is checked, you see the results of the KML
      (Keyboard Macro Language) interpreter at every emulator startup.</p></li>
    </ul>
  <h3>8.6.2 Disassembler section</h3>
    <p>Choosing the assembler syntax:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>HP Mnemonics</i>
      <p>This is the standard syntax used by HP.</p></li>
      <li><i>Class Mnemonics</i>
      <p>Class (Clarke assembler) was written by Lutz Vieweg in 1991, at a time
      when HP had not published their own development tools. The syntax is very
      similar to the AG and STAR mnemonics used at this time.</p></li>
    </ul>
  <h3>8.6.3 Sound section</h3>
    <p>A new implementation of the sound engine made ROM patches for sound
      output obsolete. The new sound engine emulates the behaviour of the
      beeper output ports and only work in connection with a sound card.
      Using the legacy PC speaker mode isn't possible any more. The old
      beeper method with a ROM patch has been removed, so you have to remove
      the ROM beep patches from your KML scripts. Actually the program
      informs you when detecting ROM beep patches by opening the &quot;KML
      Script Compilation Result&quot; dialog reporting an error.
    </p>
    <p>For the sound generation the calculator must know his own CPU strobe
      frequency. On the real calculator the speed depends on various settings
      like component tolerances, actual temperature, humidity and other
      variables. The actual speed is measured by the calculator firmware
      at a cold- or at a warmstart and stored in the =CSPEED variable. The
      content of this calculator variable has direct influence on the
      resulting frequency and duration. On the emulator the CPU strobe
      frequency is set by the registry key
      <i>HKCU\Software\Emu28\Emulator\SaturnCycles</i>. The content of this
      variable multiplied by 16384 is the CPU strobe frequency in Hz used
      by the emulator. Because older versions of the emulator were not able
      to measure the CPU strobe frequency properly or the content of the
      <i>SaturnCycles</i> has been changed since the last measurement, the
      =CSPEED variable of this session file may contain a wrong frequency
      value. You easily may discover this by measuring the actual duration
      of a 10s beep. A deviance less than 1s is ok, otherwise you should
      perform a <u style="color:red">warmstart</u> of the calculator in
      this session file. Alternatively you may execute a
      <a href=#ss9.6>Reset Calculator</a>. This recalls the measuring routine
      and save the result in the speed variable. Both restart variants purge
      the stack content!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Volume</i>
      <p>The output volume can be set with the Volume slider relative to
      the Windows Master Volume control.
      </p></li>
      <li><i>Device</i>
      <p>By default the sound device is set to &quot;Standard Audio&quot;,
      but you can also manually choose the output device. When you change
      the Standard Audio device in the Operating System settings dialog,
      the internal device numbering may change, and so the manually selected
      audio device.</p></li>
    </ul>
  <h3>8.6.4 Infrared Printer</h3>
    <p>The emulator has the ability to print data to a HP82240A/B printer
    simulation. The data transfer to the printer simulator is done over UDP.
    In this section you can the define the IPv4 address and the port the
    printer simulator is listening. A suitable HP82240B printer simulation can
    be found <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/hp82240b.htm">here</a>.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss8.7>8.7 Exit</a></h2>
    <p>Quit emulation. The default actions at finishing are defined in the
    <a href=#ss8.6>Settings</a> dialog. If the current session is
    &quot;Untitled&quot; you are asked for a session file name using the
    <a href="#ss8.4">Save As...</a> dialog. If you quit the emulator without
    a given filename, you're asked for choosing a KML script at next startup.
    </p>
  <h1><a name=s9>9. Edit Menu</a></h1>
  <h2><a name=ss9.1>9.1 Load Object...</a></h2>
    <p>This is only valid for the HP28C emulation. You can load HP28C binary
    objects to stack level 1. Therefore the object must begin with
    &quot;HPHP28-C&quot;. If the binary header isn't present, the object is
    loaded as string. Dropping HP objects over the emulator window will also
    load objects. Be sure that the emulator isn't busy before doing this.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss9.2>9.2 Save Object...</a></h2>
    <p>This is only valid for the HP28C emulation. Saves the current object
    on stack level 1 as a HP28C binary object to disk.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss9.3>9.3 Copy Screen</a></h2>
    <p>Copy the screen content in text and bitmap format to the clipboard.
    The text format work only with the regular font on the regular character
    positions. Graphic and the soft menu buttons cannot be shown in text
    mode. The actual used Latin-1 Supplement codepage don't support all
    text characters, at the position of such a character the MIDDLE DOT
    U+00B7 character is used in the clipboard text output instead.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss9.4>9.4 Copy Stack</a></h2>
    <p>This is only valid for the HP28C emulation.</p>
    <p>Copy a &quot;Real Number&quot;, &quot;Complex Number&quot; or
    &quot;String&quot; object in stack level 1 to the clipboard. On all other
    objects, the command will be ignored. This prevents sending binary objects
    to the clipboard.</p>
    <p>The decimal point (radix mark) of &quot;Real Numbers&quot; in the
    clipboard is equal to the calculator setting. This is important when
    you try to paste the numbers into a program using the locale settings
    of the host operating system.</p>
    <p>Unsupported objects will be ignored. This prevents sending binary
    objects to the clipboard.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss9.5>9.5 Paste Stack</a></h2>
    <p>This is only valid for the HP28C emulation.</p>
    <p>To import &quot;Real or Complex Numbers&quot; from the clipboard, the
    decimal point (radix mark) of the clipboard and calculator <u>must</u>
    match. A real or complex number is only detected in the case of valid
    real number characters in the clipboard. Especially heading and tailing
    white spaces aren't valid number characters also.</p>
    <p>Complex numbers must be in the form <i>(a,b)</i> when using the point
    radix mark or in the form <i>(a;b)</i> when using the comma radix mark.
    The Cartesian or algebraic form <i>a+bi</i> is not supported.</p>
    <p>Paste the text field content of the clipboard to stack level 1 of the
    emulated calculator. If the clipboard content is representing a real
    number, the number will be saved as &quot;Real Number&quot; object. Is
    the content a complex number object, the number will be saved as
    &quot;Complex Number&quot; object, otherwise cases as
    &quot;String&quot; object.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss9.6>9.6 Reset Calculator</a></h2>
    <p>This emulates the Reset pin of the internal CPU.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss9.7>9.7 Backup</a></h2>
  <h3><a name=ss9.7.1>9.7.1 Backup Save</a></h3>
    <p>This saves the current emulator status into a backup slot. If the
    backup slot already contains data, it will be overwritten.</p>
  <h3><a name=ss9.7.2>9.7.2 Backup Restore</a></h3>
    <p>This restores a previous saved emulator status without request. If you
    changed the calculator model meanwhile, the emulator will switch back to
    the model used in the backup.</p>
  <h3><a name=ss9.7.3>9.7.3 Backup Delete</a></h3>
    <p>This deletes the data in the backup slot.</p>
  <h1><a name=s10>10. View Menu</a></h1>
  <h2><a name=ss10.1>10.1 Change KML Script...</a></h2>
    <p>This allows you to change the skin of the current emulated calculator.
    In opposite to the New... command you see only scripts emulating the same
    calculator.</p>
  <h1><a name=s11>11. Tools Menu</a></h1>
  <h2><a name=ss11.1>11.1 Disassembler...</a></h2>
    <p>This is a simple disassembler.</p>
    <p>Enter the address to disassemble in hexadecimal into the &quot;Address
    (HEX)&quot; field and press &lt;Return&gt;. With the &quot;Next
    Address&quot; button the next opcode is disassembled. With the &quot;Copy
    Data&quot; button you can copy all selected lines from the list box to
    the clipboard.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss11.2>11.2 Debugger...</a></h2>
    <p>The assembler code debugger of the emulator. For more details refer to
    the extra documentation of the debugger please.</p>
  <h2><a name=ss11.3>11.3 Macro</a></h2>
    <p>The keyboard macro recorder unit.</p>
    <h3><a name=ss11.3.1>11.3.1 Macro Record...</a></h3>
      <p>Prompts a dialog to enter the macro file for the data to record. After

  <h1><a name=s13>13. DDE Server</a></h1>
    <p>Emu28 has an integrated DDE server to transmit data from and to the HP
    stack. Because only the HP28C has a stack, all DDE transfers are ignored on
    the other calculators. You have the same restrictions like with the commands
    &quot;Load object...&quot; and &quot;Save Object...&quot;, that a running
    program may corrupt memory. In difference you can choose the stack level
    for the transfer in the DDE item field. Take care to transmit data only
    after the acknowledge of the last DDE transaction.</p>
    <p>Technical data:</p>
